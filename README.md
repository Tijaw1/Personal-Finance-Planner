The program allows the credit union members to assess their monthly personal finances, and be able to forecast a reasonably good retirement plan based on cryptocurrencies, stocks, and bonds funds the members have.

The personal finance planner will allow members/users to visualize their savings composed by investments in shares and cryptocurrencies to assess if they have enough money as an emergency fund.

The retirement planning tool will use the Alpaca API to fetch historical closing prices for a retirement portfolio composed of stocks and bonds, then run Monte Carlo simulations to project the portfolio performance at 30 years. It will use  the Monte Carlo data to calculate the expected portfolio returns given a specific initial investment amount.

The program also allows the members/users to run Monte Carlo simulations to project the portfolio performance at 5 and 10 years. It will use the simulation data to calculate the expected portfolio returns given a specific initial investment amount.
